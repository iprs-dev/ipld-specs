# Concept: Content Addressability

"Content addressability" refers to the ability to refer to content by a trustless identifier.

Rather than referring to content by a string identifier or URL, content addressable systems refer to content
by a cryptographic hash. This allows complete decentralization of the content as the identifier
does not specify the retrieval method and provides a secure way to verify the content.
