Schema Kinds
------------

Recursive types contain additional type definitions for either their
keys (in the case of maps),
values (in the case of maps and lists),
or fields (in the case of structs).

Value Type Modifiers
--------------------

Values and fields in recursive types can have modifiers.

### Nullable Values

The `nullable` modifier means that either the modified type may be present,
**or** its place may be occupied by the null value.

The `nullable` modifier is valid on map values, list values, and struct fields.

The presence of a `nullable` modifier increases the cardinality of a field's
valid members by one -- see the "Cardinality Examples" table below.

### Optional Fields

The `optional` modifier means that either the modified type may be present,
**or** it may be missing entirely in the data.  This is distinct from null:
for example, in a map, optionality regards if the key is *missing*,
in contrast to the key being present but with a value of null.

The `optional` modifier is only valid on struct fields (and only for some
representation strategies; structs represented as maps and structs represented
as lists have slightly different optionality semantics (e.g. list-based
representations may only allow optionals at the beginning and end of the list)).

The presence of an `optional` modifier increases the cardinality of a field's
valid members by one -- see the "Cardinality Examples" table below.

The `optional` modifier may be stacked with the `nullable` modifier.

### Fields with Defaults

Defaults are somewhat more complicated than the other two modifiers,
and also unusually, are a concept that resides in the *representation* clause
rather than the *type* definition clause.

The precise semantics of defaults vary per representation strategy;
the discussion here is only for the general pattern, and you should also
refer to the [reference documentation for representation strategies](./representations.md#representation-strategy-reference)
for more details specific to the representations strategies you use.

(FUTURE: there's discussion that "default" may not be the clearest name for
this concepts.  Alternatives floated include "absent", "void", "omitted"...)

### Combining Nullable, Optional, and Default

The `nullable` and `default` modifiers may be freely combined without issue.

It is not valid to combine the `optional` and `default` modifiers.
