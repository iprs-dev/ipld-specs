# IPLD Exploratory Specifications

This directory is the home for all exploratory stage specifications.

This stage is used for specifications that are still expected to change dramatically.

Having implementations does not mean a specification is ready to move on to 
draft stage. Implementations of exploratory specifications often exist and serve to inform spec changes
and eventual graduation to draft stage when appropriate.
