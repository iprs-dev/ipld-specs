# IPLD Exploratory Specifications

[This is the home](https://github.com/ipld/specs/tree/master/design) for all exploratory stage specifications
and other design notes.

Nothing documented here should be considered final and the contribution guidelines allow any conributor to
add new documents without consensus.

Having implementations does not mean a specification is ready to move on to
draft stage. Implementations of exploratory specifications often exist and serve to inform spec changes
and eventual graduation to draft stage when appropriate.
