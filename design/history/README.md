IPLD Design History
===================

This folder is for reference material that was part of the design history of IPLD.

Some of this material may represent works-in-progress; others have become historical.
(We do not attempt to differentiate these in advance, because it's only in retrospect
that it becomes clear whether an idea is going somewhere, or not!)
It's called "history", but it may also be the source of innovation!

We put content here for archival reference; but also, we have defined how we
organize content in this directory in such a way as to make it encourage
writing things down -- even (and especially) new ideas.

One trait that's unified across files within this directory is that we treat them
as (roughly) *append-only*.  This is because we want to use them as touchpoints
in discussion, and *not as the discussion format itself*.

Therefore, if you encounter a document in the history directory that you think
needs substantial iteration and new content, the way to move forward is:

- gather your ideas and start writing
- prepare to create a new file
- commit and share your notes, linking to existing content where you can.

If you don't have push access to this repository, or want to start writing and
sharing even earlier iterations of thoughts, Github Gists are also a great way
to handle this style of editing.
This directory can be thought of roughly like a collection of gists; we've just
gathered the ones especially relevant to the evolution of the design of IPLD.
