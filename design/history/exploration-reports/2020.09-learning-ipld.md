# Journey learning the IPLD stack

Author: Daniel Mart√≠ (@mvdan)

It was suggested that I should capture my perspective as I get up to speed on
the IPLD stack, so that we can possibly identify shortcomings with the current
material, or topics which can cause problems.

### Previous knowledge

I should note that I was already familiar with hashing, Git, type systems and
data structures, encodings like JSON and Protobuf, and compatibility between
different programming languages. So the "block" and "data model" layers of IPLD
were relatively easy to understand.

### First impression

The docs are somewhat scattered and unfinished, which does make it a little
extra confusing to get started. In chronological order, I read:

1) https://hackmd.io/LHTTmGSWSvem4Wz2h_a39g?both, Eric's "terse primer". Seems
   to try to cover everything, though it does seem like quite a lot of
   information to take in all at once.

2) https://ipld.github.io/docs/, sourced at https://github.com/ipld/docs. Seems
   aimed at getting started with tutorials in JS. I should note that I first
   read this before Mikeal's "new intro" added on September 2nd 2020.

3) https://github.com/ipld/specs, which seems to contain all the formal specs,
   but also includes a pretty decent README.

I think all three should probably be unified into two halves:

* A high-level introduction to IPLD, max 3-4 pages. Probably extending Mikeal's
  new intro with some material from Eric's primer?

* The set of spec documents, with a README to classify and introduce each of the
  groups or layers. I think the specs repo already does a decent job at this.

### Concepts that confused me

I already raised some of these as Slack threads or HackMD comments, but for the
sake of keeping record, I'm listing the most basic or important ones here.

* It is said that a link is unlike a URL, since it is merely a hash of data
  that doesn't statically say where to fetch the data from. So... how would one
  ever actually fetch data via a link?

* Out of the three layers (blocks, data model, schemas), Schemas have been by
  far the hardest to wrap my head around. I think an introduction should contain
  a very brief example, including how it actually looks like when mapped to the
  data model and encoded into a block.

The following are more such points, but focused around schemas, once I got to
that part of the spec:

* My first read about ADLs left me very confused, in particular how they're
  different than Schemas. I found the "Mapped to the Data Model" introduction to
  ADLs much easier to understand, as it shows reasonable examples.

* Why are multi-block data structures a separate definition in the spec, and not
  just part of Schemas?

* Are blocks generally filled with data nearly completely, or is it normal to
  have them relatively empty?

* Wouldn't removing the first byte from a very long multi-block List mean that
  every block would need to be modified to shift all bytes forward by one? I
  assume and hope not, but the spec doesn't really give pointers.

* Since data in blocks is encoded from the data model, how would Iknow if a
  particular data model value fits in a single block? What about a shema value?

* Would IPLD be much different if the data model was an internal detail, and not
  exposed to the user? I imagine that, most of the time, one would interact with
  schemas and not the data model.

* When docs say "the IPLD type system", is that in terms of Schemas, or the Data
  Model, or both? Answer: The schema intro later says that "types" are for
  schemas, and "kinds" for the data model. That should probably be sooner in the
  schema spec.

* For new IPLD team members in the future, it's probably best if their first
  week is focused on the basics alone - blocks, hashing, linking, encodings, and
  the data model. That's enough for some realistic demos using IPLD, and can be
  learned in half a day, allowing the person to start contributing without
  multiple full days of reading. I should clarify that Eric did give me a data
  model issue to work on during my first week, but I never picked up on the "you
  don't need to read about schemas for now" nudge.

* The specs README hierarchy presents these three concepts in order: multi-block
  collections, schemas, and ADLs. The docs do explain why schemas and ADLs are
  different, but not why multi-block collections are also a separate thing. Eric
  mentioned that multi-block collections are pretty much ADLs; so why are they
  introduced before schemas?

* The schema authoring guide talks about "component specifiers" and "component
  specifications", but never seems to define them.
